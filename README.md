# ML-electron-density

Class Project for Applied Physics 275: Computational Design of Materials (Harvard University)

Machine learning the mapping from external potential to interacting ground-state electron density for molecular and solid-state systems. 



# Machine Learning Ground State Electron Densities
## A project by S. Batzner, S. Torrisi, and J. Vandermause

## Project Overview

We present a comparative study in which we benchmark various machine learning-based regression frameworks to learning the ground-state electron energy and density of a H2 dimer and an Aluminum crystal. This extends the work of Brockherde _et al_ to the Solid State and explores the possibiliy of a potential-energy mapping across other ML frameworks.

We present our work across datasets generated in Quantum ESPRESSO and one generated from the Quantum Monte Carlo code QMCPACK. Included in this work is a library of functions and objects to assist in the automated generation and analysis of these data sets. The exposition proceeds through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, so that the results of our study are easily replicable.


## Overview of Code

Interested readers should visit the GitHub repo of our project, in which we document various ways to reproduce the datasets and analysis yourself in the 'start_here' folder.

You will need some of the following:

1. A local installation of the Quantum ESPRESSO package.
